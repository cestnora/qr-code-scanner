_**QR Code Scanner with Audio-Visual Support for the Visually Impaired**_

**Hardware Setup**
(1) Raspberry Pi
(2) Input Devices
- Raspberry Pi Camera: Captures real-time video input for QR code detection.
- Keyboard and Mouse: Assist in user interaction and debugging, connected via USB.
(3) Output Devices
- Raspberry Pi Sense HAT: Displays text messages on its LED matrix, providing visual feedback to the user.
- Computer Speaker: Outputs audio feedback generated by the gTTS module, ensuring an auditory response to detected QR codes.
- Computer Monitor: Displays real-time video and debugging information, aiding in system development and testing.

**Software Setup**
(1) QR Code Generation: qrcode 8.0
(2) QR Code Recognition: opencv-python 4.10.0.84
(3) Text Display: sense-hat 2.6.0
(4) gTTS 2.5.4 (Google Text-to-Speech)
(5) Real-time Audio Player: pygame.mixer.music

**Functionalities**
(1) Real-time QR Code Recognition: The system detects and decodes QR codes in real-time using a camera and displays the detected content visually and audibly.
(3) Visual Display of Texts: The decoded text is displayed on the LED matrix of the SenseHAT, providing a clear and immediate visual reference for users.
(4) Text-to-Speech Conversion: The system can convert the decoded text from QR codes into audio feedback using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.
(5) Real-time Audio Playback: It should play the saved audio immediately after text-to-speech conversion using the pygame.mixer library, ensuring seamless user interaction.
