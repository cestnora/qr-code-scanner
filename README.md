_**QR Code Scanner with Audio-Visual Support for the Visually Impaired**_

**Hardware Setup**<br />
1. Raspberry Pi<br />
2. Input Devices<br />
  (1) Raspberry Pi Camera: Captures real-time video input for QR code detection.<br />
  (2) Keyboard and Mouse: Assist in user interaction and debugging, connected via USB.<br />
3. Output Devices<br />
  (1) Raspberry Pi Sense HAT: Displays text messages on its LED matrix, providing visual feedback to the user.<br />
  (2) Computer Speaker: Outputs audio feedback generated by the gTTS module, ensuring an auditory response to detected QR codes.<br />
  (3) Computer Monitor: Displays real-time video and debugging information, aiding in system development and testing.<br />

**Software Setup**<br />
1. QR Code Generation: qrcode 8.0<br />
2. QR Code Recognition: opencv-python 4.10.0.84<br />
3. Text Display: sense-hat 2.6.0<br />
4. gTTS 2.5.4 (Google Text-to-Speech)<br />
5. Real-time Audio Player: pygame.mixer.music<br />

**Functionalities Achieved**<br />
1. Real-time QR Code Recognition: The system detects and decodes QR codes in real-time using a camera and displays the detected content visually and audibly.<br />
2. Visual Display of Texts: The decoded text is displayed on the LED matrix of the SenseHAT, providing a clear and immediate visual reference for users.<br />
3. Text-to-Speech Conversion: The system can convert the decoded text from QR codes into audio feedback using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.<br />
4. Real-time Audio Playback: It should play the saved audio immediately after text-to-speech conversion using the pygame.mixer library, ensuring seamless user interaction.
